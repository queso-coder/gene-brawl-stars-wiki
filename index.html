      Gene is a mythic brawler who is a controller brawler as of 8/7/2023. His main attack is called "Smoke blast" which allows Gene's oil lamp to shoot a ball of oil to opponents. If it doesn't hit any enemies, it splits into 6 projectiles in a dagger like shape. At power 11, his oil ball deals 1440 damage and on of his 6 projectiles after splitting deals 240 damage. He has 5400 health at power 11.
      His super is called "Magic hand" a giant hand which can go through walls and pull players to him. Without his spirit slap star power equipped, his super deals no damage. His movement is normal and his reload speed for his attack is 2 seconds (slow).

      Gene's first gadget
      <h3>
        Gene's first gadget is called "Lamp Blowout". Gene pushes all brawlers within a 2.67 tile radius of him. If at least one brawler within this radius is pushed, then Gene gains 600 health. Unlike some other brawlers, Gene can still use this gadget at full health.

    Gene's second gadget
    <h3>
      Gene's second gadget is called "Vengeful Spirits". Gene shoots a missile that tracks all players within a 11 tile radius of Gene. The minimum amount damage being 250 (the closest to Gene) and the maximum being 1,000 (the farthest from Gene). This missile cannot attack players who are in bushes or are invisible. I would reccomend Gene's first gadget over this one.
